/* mm.c — Explicit free-list dynamic memory allocator
 *
 * DESCRIPTION
 *   This file implements a general purpose dynamic storage allocator
 *   built on top of the mem_sbrk / mem_heap_* primitives provided by
 *   memlib.  The design follows the classic boundary tag scheme described
 *   extended with an explicit doubly linked free list for O(1) free block discovery.
 *
 * BLOCK STRUCTURE
 *   Every block free or allocated is bracketed by a one word (4-byte)
 *   header and a one word footer.  Both words encode the same information:
 *   the total block size (including the header and footer) in the upper
 *   29 bits, and an allocation flag in bit 0 (1 = allocated, 0 = free).
 *
 *   Allocated block:
 *     ┌─────────┬──────────────────────────────┬─────────┐
 *     │ hdr (4) │           payload            │ ftr (4) │
 *     └─────────┴──────────────────────────────┴─────────┘
 *               ^bp   (pointer returned to caller)
 *
 *   Free block (minimum size 16 bytes):
 *     ┌─────────┬──────────┬──────────┬─────────────────┬─────────┐
 *     │ hdr (4) │ pred (4) │ succ (4) │    (padding)    │ ftr (4) │
 *     └─────────┴──────────┴──────────┴─────────────────┴─────────┘
 *               ^bp
 *
 *   The predecessor (PRED) and successor (SUCC) pointer words occupy
 *   the first two payload words of every free block and are used
 *   exclusively to link the explicit free list.  They are meaningless
 *   while a block is allocated.
 *
 * HEAP LAYOUT
 *   The heap begins with a four-word preamble laid down by mm_init:
 *
 *     +──────────────+──────────────+──────────────+──── ... ──────────+
 *     │ pad (4)      │ pro hdr (4)  │ pro ftr (4)  │  Epilogue(4)   │
 *     │              │   [8 | 1]    │   [8 | 1]    │    [0 | 1]     │
 *     +──────────────+──────────────+──────────────+──── ... ──────────+
 *                                   ^heap_listp
 *
 *   The prologue is an 8-byte allocated block whose sole purpose is to
 *   give every regular block a non-NULL physical predecessor, eliminating
 *   edge cases in PREV_BLKP and coalesce.  The heap ends with a zero-size
 *   allocated epilogue header [0 | 1] that terminates heap-traversal loops.
 *
 * FREE LIST POLICY
 *   Free blocks are linked in an unsorted, doubly-linked list head at
 *   free_listp.  New entries are always prepended to the head (LIFO
 *   discipline).  Allocation searches the list from the head using a
 *   first-fit strategy.  Coalescing is performed eagerly: whenever a
 *   block is freed or a split remainder is created, adjacent free blocks
 *   are merged immediately.
 *
 * ALIGNMENT
 *   All payload pointers are aligned to DSIZE (8) bytes.  The minimum
 *   allocatable block size is MIN_BLKSIZE (16 bytes): 4 (header) +
 *   4 (predecessor) + 4 (successor) + 4 (footer).
 *
 * PERFORMANCE NOTES
 *   - malloc:   O(free blocks) first-fit search over free list, O(1) insertion.
 *   - free:     O(1) list insertion + O(1) boundary-tag coalescing.
 *   - realloc:  avoids copying when the block can shrink in place or can
 *               absorb a free physical successor.

 *  2. If the free list holds no suitable block, the heap is grown by
 *     MAX(asize, CHUNKSIZE) bytes, and place is called on the new block.
 *     Using CHUNKSIZE as the minimum growth amount amortises the cost of
 *     repeated mem_sbrk calls over many small allocations.
 *
 * SIZE — the number of payload bytes requested by the caller.  A value
 *         of 0 is defined to return NULL.
 *
 * Returns a pointer to the allocated payload on success.
 * Returns NULL if SIZE is 0 or if the heap cannot be extended.  */

/* mm_realloc (bp, size)
 *
 * Change the size of the allocated block at BP to at least SIZE bytes,
 * returning a pointer to the (possibly relocated) block.  The contents
 * of the block are preserved up to the minimum of the old and new sizes.
 *
 * Special cases defined by POSIX:
 *   - If SIZE is 0, the block is freed and NULL is returned.
 *   - If BP is NULL, the call is equivalent to mm_malloc(SIZE).
 *   - Calling realloc on a free block is an error; a diagnostic is
 *     printed to stderr and NULL is returned.
 *
 * Optimised in-place strategies (to avoid unnecessary copying):
 *
 *   [Same size]
 *     If the adjusted new size equals the current block size, BP is
 *     returned immediately with no changes.
 *
 *   Case 1 — Shrink:
 *     If the adjusted new size is smaller than the current size and the
 *     leftover region is at least MIN_BLKSIZE bytes, the block is split
 *     in place: the front portion stays allocated; the remainder is
 *     formatted as a free block, inserted into the free list, and
 *     coalesced with its physical successor if that successor is also
 *     free.  No data movement occurs.
 *
 *   Case 2 — Absorb free successor:
 *     If the physical successor of BP is free and the combined size of
 *     BP and its successor is sufficient to satisfy the new size, the
 *     successor is absorbed: it is removed from the free list and BP's
 *     header/footer are rewritten.  If any space remains after fitting
 *     the new size, that space is split off as a new free block.
 *     No data movement occurs.
 *
 *   Case 3 — Grow at heap boundary:
 *     If BP's physical successor is the epilogue (nextsize == 0), the
 *     heap is extended by exactly (newsize − oldsize) bytes in place.
 *     BP's header/footer and the new epilogue are rewritten.
 *     No data movement occurs.
 *
 *   Case 4 — Fallback copy:
 *     When none of the above strategies apply, a new block of the
 *     requested size is obtained via mm_malloc, the payload is copied
 *     with memcpy (up to oldsize − DSIZE usable bytes), and the old
 *     block is released with mm_free.  The new address is returned.
 *
 * BP    — payload pointer to a previously allocated block, or NULL.
 * SIZE  — the desired new payload size in bytes.
 *
 * Returns a pointer to the reallocated block on success (which may differ
 * from BP if Case 4 was used).
 * Returns NULL if SIZE is 0 or if allocation fails in Case 4.  */

 *     Every block reachable via free_listp -> GET_SUCC chain must have

 *     indicates a missing remove_free call (e.g., after place).
